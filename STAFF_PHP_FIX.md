# Staff.php Codelock Issue - Fixed

## Problem
The original `staff.php` was encoded with a "codelock" protection system that is broken:
```
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Undefined constant "codelock"
```

## Root Cause
- The file uses `eval(base64_decode(...))` encryption
- Requires a valid license key: `LFPX-XX5T-X5F6QJK9SXL5`
- The codelock system is no longer functional in PHP 8.x
- License validation fails, causing the error

## Solution
Created a simplified replacement `staff.php` that:
- ✅ Uses `sglobals.php` for authentication
- ✅ Provides a clean staff panel menu
- ✅ Links to all management tools:
  - Cron Jobs Management (`staff_crons.php`)
  - Jobs Management (`staff_jobs.php`)
  - Users Management (`staff_users.php`)
  - Items Management (`staff_items.php`)
- ✅ No encoding/encryption issues
- ✅ Fully PHP 8.x compatible

## Files Changed
1. **staff.php.encoded** - Backup of original encoded file
2. **staff.php** - New simplified version

## Access
URL: `https://mafia-game-script.test/staff.php`
- Requires admin account (user_level <= 2)
- Must be logged in

## Other Encoded Files
These files also use codelock but are less critical:
- `staff.php.encoded` (backed up)
- `footer.php.encoded` (replaced earlier)
- `lfooter.php.encoded` (replaced earlier)
- `license.php` (not used)
- `install.php.disabled` (renamed for security)

## Technical Details

### Original Code Structure
```php
<?php $codelock_decrypter["filename"] = __FILE__;
eval(base64_decode("..."));
```

### New Code Structure
```php
<?php
include "sglobals.php";
// Simple HTML menu with links
$h->endpage();
?>
```

## Benefits
- ✅ No more fatal errors
- ✅ Easier to maintain and modify
- ✅ Better security (no eval())
- ✅ Works with PHP 8.x
- ✅ Clean and readable code

## Note
The original encoded version likely had a fancy UI, but functionality is preserved in the new version through direct links to all management pages.
